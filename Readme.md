# Cordova Album Viewer Sample

This project is a sample application for the following CODE Magazine article:

**[Taming Mobile Apps with Cordova and Visual Studio](http://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2015/Mar/04/Cordova-and-Visual-Studio-CODE-Magazine-Article)**

and blog post:

**[Using Cordova and Visual Studio to build iOS Mobile Apps](http://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2015/Jan/06/Using-Cordova-and-Visual-Studio-to-build-iOS-Mobile-Apps)**

*The current version is built for Visual Studio 2015 RC - use the VS2013 CTP3 tag to use an earlier VS2013 version*

The sample application is a small Album Viewer that lets you browse and edit a number of music albums interactively. Data is local and on device only to make it easy to run the app and play without without having to configure external services.
